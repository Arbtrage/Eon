## **1. Overview**  
The **Agentic API Support Chatbot** leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide intelligent and contextual responses to user queries based on your API documentation. Its capabilities include:  
- Parsing and storing API documentation in a structured knowledge base.  
- Answering user queries with high accuracy.  
- Running API calls on behalf of the user and validating their correctness.  
- Suggesting fixes for errors in API calls.  

This chatbot aims to enhance productivity for developers by simplifying API exploration and troubleshooting.  

---

## **2. Features**  
- **Knowledge Ingestion**: Automatically processes and ingests API documentation to build a semantic knowledge base.  
- **Query Handling**: Answers user questions using GPT-powered models and retrieves relevant information using embeddings.  
- **API Validation**: Executes API calls, checks for errors, and suggests fixes to ensure correct implementation.  
- **Slack Integration**: Seamless interaction within Slack channels, responding to specific user queries in real time.  
- **Dynamic Updates**: Supports updating the knowledge base with new documentation and user feedback.

## **3. Architecture**  

### **High-Level Architecture**  
1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to microservices.  
2. **Knowledge Ingestion Service**: Processes and stores API documentation.  
3. **Chatbot Service**: Handles user interactions and query resolution.  
4. **API Validation Service**: Executes and validates user-provided API calls.  
5. **Search Service**: Performs semantic search on the knowledge base using vector embeddings.  
6. **Slack Integration Service**: Facilitates real-time bot interactions in Slack.

## **4. Technologies Used**  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python  
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT via LangChain  
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for text storage and Milvus for vector embeddings  
- **Search**: Semantic search powered by FAISS  
- **Slack Integration**: Slack APIs  
- **Containerization**: Docker (microservices in isolated containers)  
- **Orchestration**: TurboRepo for managing monorepo architecture  

---

## **5. Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python (>=3.9)  
- Docker and Docker Compose  
- MongoDB and Milvus running locally or on a cloud instance  
- OpenAI API key  
- Slack App credentials (Bot Token, Signing Secret)  

### **Setup Instructions**  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/agentic-api-chatbot.git  
   cd agentic-api-chatbot  
   ```  

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:  
   ```env  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key  
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri  
   MILVUS_HOST=localhost  
   MILVUS_PORT=19530  
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token  
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret  
   ```  

4. **Run the services with Docker**:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up --build  
   ```  

5. **Access the services**:  
   - API Gateway: `http://localhost:8000`  
   - Slack bot: Add it to your Slack workspace.

## **6. Usage**  

### **Chatbot Query**  
- Interact with the chatbot through the web app or Slack.  
- Example query:  
  > *"How do I authenticate using Crustdata API?"*  

### **API Validation**  
- Provide an API call (e.g., HTTP request), and the bot will validate and suggest fixes.  

---

## **7. Deployment**  

### **Cloud Deployment**  
- Use platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy microservices.  
- Recommended setup:  
  - Use **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.  
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.  

---

## **8. Future Enhancements**  
- Add support for additional channels like Teams or Discord.  
- Implement multilingual support.  
- Extend API validation to suggest alternative APIs.  
- Enhance Slack bot for multi-user context tracking.
